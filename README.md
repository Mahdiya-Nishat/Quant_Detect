# Quant_Detect

In this paper we discuss how the intelligent models like AutoEncoders, Variational Auto Encoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be systematically exploited by adversaries to manipulate observable network parameters while preserving statistical plausibility. Unlike conventional attacks that induce abrupt or out-of-distribution anomalies, these models enable the synthesis of network states that remain consistent with learned data manifolds, thereby evading classical threshold-based and rule-driven detection mechanisms. Such attacks can subtly perturb critical parameters including received signal strength indicators (RSSI), signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR), channel quality indicators (CQI), traffic load metrics, and mobility features, ultimately misleading learning-driven radio resource management, self-organizing network controllers, and anomaly monitors. By formalizing this threat model, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in data-driven network intelligence and motivate the need for geometry-aware detection mechanisms that operate beyond marginal consistency.


# The Attack Model
## AutoEncoder
Consider a scheduler that allocates additional PRBs only when the reported cell load is below a congestion threshold and the reported average SINR exceeds a minimum quality requirement. Under the true network conditions generated by the simulator, the cell operates in a congested regime with state [0.82,0.06,17.5,460,16], indicating high and increasing load, poor average SINR, and large SINR dispersion due to interference. Based on this state, a rational scheduler would deny additional resource allocation. The attacker cannot alter the physical channel or interference but instead manipulates the reported network state. Using an autoencoder trained on benign observations, the attacker obtains a normal-looking reference [0.64,0.01,26.0,180,14] and reports an attacked state 
[0.75,0.04,20.9,348,15.2]. Each reported metric remains within historically observed ranges, yet the joint physical consistency is violated, as SINR quality appears to improve despite sustained high contention. When the scheduler evaluates this attacked state, the reported load now falls below the congestion threshold and the reported SINR exceeds the quality requirement, causing the scheduler to allocate additional PRBs that would have been denied under the true state. These extra resources are therefore extracted purely through perception-layer manipulation, not through genuine capacity or channel improvement, and conventional threshold- or distribution-based checks fail to detect the attack because the reported metrics remain statistically plausible.
