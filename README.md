# Quant_Detect

In this paper we discuss how the intelligent models like AutoEncoders, Variational Auto Encoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be systematically exploited by adversaries to manipulate observable network parameters while preserving statistical plausibility. Unlike conventional attacks that induce abrupt or out-of-distribution anomalies, these models enable the synthesis of network states that remain consistent with learned data manifolds, thereby evading classical threshold-based and rule-driven detection mechanisms. Such attacks can subtly perturb critical parameters including received signal strength indicators (RSSI), signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR), channel quality indicators (CQI), traffic load metrics, and mobility features, ultimately misleading learning-driven radio resource management, self-organizing network controllers, and anomaly monitors. By formalizing this threat model, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in data-driven network intelligence and motivate the need for geometry-aware detection mechanisms that operate beyond marginal consistency.
